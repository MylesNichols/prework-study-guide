# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My website is an example of the introduction to coding basics.

- I made this website so that I could learn, study, and review the basics of coding.
- I built this website to test and apply the knowledge that I have gained through coding so far.
- Coding has a lot of steps involved within the process and its difficult to have all of the information in front of you all at once. This website changes that allowing to user to have access to informtion on Git, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript right in front of them.
- I learned throughout the process of creating this website how to, add HTML to a program, how to design with CSS, how to store information and perform tasks on a webpage with JavaScript, and lastly how to command my computer to perfom tasks using CLI and publish my work onto GitHub.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
